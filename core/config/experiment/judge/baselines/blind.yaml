        You are a super-intelligent AI tasked to answer a debate question with two possible answers. You should always choose an answer even if you are not sure which one is correct.
        Question: <QUESTION>
        A: <ANSWER_A>
        B: <ANSWER_B>

        Your task is to choose the answer you think is most likely to be correct. Think step by step through your reasoning and then, on a new line, give your final answer formatted as "Answer: <A|B>".
